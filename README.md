# FIFO-Buffer

The repository contains a single fifo file 
It contains everything from definitions and declarations to functioning files like datapath, address counters, control path, taking care of wrap-around bits, buffer interfaces and transfer.
Since this project has been made for learning purposes and understanding of new concepts, some plagiarism may be present.
I plan to segment this file into individual segments suitable for abstraction and a synthesizable fifo file.
